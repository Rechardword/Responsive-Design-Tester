# Responsive Webdesign Tester

I coded this script to test my server-side driven RWD websites back in 2011.
Thousands of online alternative now exist, this script was created to work offline from my computer.

It also comes with a few nice features like change orientation & scrollbar & and navigation bar.

[Online demo](http://www.remi-grumeau.com/projects/rwd-tester/responsive-design-tester.php?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.remi-grumeau.com%2F&d=1024x600&scroll=on#).


# Install
Just copy/paste this script (and its CSS file) to wherever you want. (yes mate, even there if you want...)

# How to use
Just type a URL in the topbar, it reloads/updates the frame below as you type.

You can then choose between the few resolutions/devices on the top right. If you want this change to be "permanent" (aka when you hit Cmd+R or F5), click on "OK"

You can swap width/height values by clicking on "rotate"
